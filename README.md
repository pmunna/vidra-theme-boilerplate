# Development

Our version of theme styles are compiled using Gulp and Node for compiling files and pages.
You'll need Node and Gulp installed globally.
After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Now you can edit `/src/` files, like css/js, which will be compiled to `/public/assets/` automatically.

The design system is in vidra-components folder.
In development open bash tab and in root directory:

```bash
$ gulp
```
