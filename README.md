# Development

Our version of theme styles are compiled using Node which you'll need to install globally.
After that, navigate to the theme's root directory and run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Now you can edit `/src/` files, like css/js, which will be compiled to `/public/assets/` automatically.

The design system is in vidra-components folder.
In development open bash tab and in root directory:

```bash
$ gulp
```
